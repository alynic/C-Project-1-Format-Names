

* Objectives:
  To learn list programming using C++. 
  To learn input/output in C++.
  This program is to change the format of names. 

  (*requirement) 
  Use array or/and linked-list for implementation.  

* Input
  Names (in various formats) from a file. 

* Output
  Names in the given format: "Last, First M1 M2 ..." 

* Process
  Change the format of names to the given format: "Last, First M1 M2 ..." 
  (as specified below) 

* Specification: 
 
  Consider following assumptions:
  - There are input of 10 names.
    (When you have no more name in the input file, the program stops.)  
  - All input lines contain less than 30 characters.
  - There can be more than one blank between the first and last names.
  - There are no leading or trailing blanks.
  - Only one last name exists in each name. Only one first name in a name. 
  - The input may include several middle names. If we have an input with blanks 
	within the names, we consider the input includes several middle names in it. 
 
  Until (no more name in the input file)
    Read each name from the iput file, and print it. 
    Change names to the given format "Last, First M1 M2 ...", and print it. 

  Output Example
    Print both names (original, changed). 

	Original  				Changed   
	-----------------------------           ----------------------------
	Last, First Middle                      Last, First Middle
	Last,      First      Middle            Last, First Middle
	First Middle Last                       Last, First Middle
	First      Middle      Last             Last, First Middle
	First Middle-1 Middle-2 Last            Last, First Middle-1 Middle-2
	Last, First  Middle-1  Middle-2         Last, First Middle-1 Middle-2 
	First      Last                         Last, First
	Last,      First                        Last, First
	... (build 2 more cases) 		... 
	(total 10 different cases including above)
